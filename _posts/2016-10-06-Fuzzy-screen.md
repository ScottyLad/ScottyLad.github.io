Today we kept on with our computer project (Raspberry Pi) We faced a big problem on our way. When the screen loaded it went all blurry and turned very fuzzy. We have faced this before but the last few times we could fix it. So we started working as a 4 with another pair. Then a computer in the other room was not being used because the 2 people had to go to a football match. We managed to get through 2 different codes on that computer.
