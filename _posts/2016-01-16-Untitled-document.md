ICT lesson 15.1.16

In ICT today we were learning about media. I found out that there were lots more type of media that i firstly knew about. I enjoyed the lesson and i got a lot out of it. I think maybe deconstructing the media could of been better.

For homework i deconstructed the mr. Bean add by Snickers. I looked through it a few times concentrating on different things each time. I think my homework and classwork went well.
