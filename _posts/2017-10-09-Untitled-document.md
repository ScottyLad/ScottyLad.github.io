In the past few weeks of IT we have been taught how to code on a spreadsheet. This has taught me new useful techniques which will help me in IT this year as I didn't know the beginning of the year. This will also be useful by just generally using google sheets for my work in the future.

Lesson 1:

This lesson we spent most the time talking about behaviour and levels of  achievement. I didn't think this was useful. We spent a tiny bit of time writing out the alphabet and the coded version.

Lesson 2:

We missed this lesson due to school photos.

Lesson 3:

We were one lesson behind all the other classes so we needed to catch up. We did a lot from this lesson and also learnt alot. We managed to catch up with all the other classes. This improved my spreadsheet because i didn't really understand coding before.

Lesson 4:

Lesson 4 i managed to do lots of work confidently and finish my work early which was a change for me. This gave me lots of confidence and i also managed to help others.
