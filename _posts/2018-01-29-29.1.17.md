29.1.17

Today in ICT we were looking at creating some code for the quiz that we created last lesson. We were at the front of the room for around 30 minutes looking at how to do this. I found this quite confusing. Afterwards I asked my teacher if I should do a new quiz. He said I could try to do mine but the coding would be to long. In the lesson I had to create a new quiz whilst everyone was looking at the code aspects. I never got around to doing any coding so I am quite far behind. Although I managed to create another quiz with a basic maths concept behind it.
