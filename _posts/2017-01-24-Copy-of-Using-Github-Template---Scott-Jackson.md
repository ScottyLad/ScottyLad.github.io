    <td>In today's lesson I broadened my understanding of coding and the language used in coding. When we were in code academy and started working through the exercises I found the instructions on the side useful because it helped me learn new things and work through the exercises easier and more efficient. Sometimes I struggled and used the tip button.</td>
