5.1.17

Today we moved classes and went into our 2nd term of ICT. There was a bit of confusion because we originally thought we were going to Drama. After 5 minutes or so we found out that we were in the other ICT classroom with the macbooks. In the lesson we were learning how computers count and record high numbers. We went over binary(base 2 counting system) and worked out how to recognise if they were even or odd and add up some quickly. We also learnt what the power button symbolises. We moved on to learn about bits and bytes and how much bytes are in a computer At the end of the lesson we watched how Gangnam Style by PSY broke youtube, luckily we also got to watch the video at the end of the lesson.
