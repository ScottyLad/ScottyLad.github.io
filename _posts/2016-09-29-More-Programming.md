Today my partner and I carried on with the fuzebox book. We did this one activity where we had to enter lots of numbers. I never really understood what it was going to do when we were finished. We also started trying to make a game where the computer tried to guess our number between 1-100 but we never finished this. For the first 20 mins of the lesson some people were fixing their github so i didn't do a lot. I reset my github password so it is more memorable. I think we got a bit distracted after a while.
