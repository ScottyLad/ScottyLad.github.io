In today's lesson we were talking about our blogs. We looked at criteria for a good blog post. We looked at some people's blogs and said what needed to be improved and what was good. I didn't really understand what CSS and YML files were, so I was confused. Today's lesson certainly taught me what I need to do for a good post and what they look like. I think I need to sort out my background and hopefully learn new tricks to make my blog look as good as it can. Today's lesson has certainly helped me and made the targets clear.
