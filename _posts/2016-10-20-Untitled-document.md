**Raspberry Pi 13.10.16**

Today was another Raspberry Pi lesson. It was fun as we played around with the coding, making the computer say funny things while learning a whole new load of coding skills with my partner working through the book.

The best thing about today was working with my friends, of course followed very closely by learning lots. These were things like how to use a memory stick, as I now know that you are able to transfer documents from one computer to another. Also, have enhanced my coding command vocabulary, knowing what CLS means (clear the screen) and what the $ sign means (the person receiving the code can write the answer e.g "What's your name?"; Name$ “That’s a nice name!” END). I also worked out how to save problems which was causing me some difficulties.
