Today in this lesson at the beginning I wanted to add a container background. This is because no fonts would work on my background. This caused a lot of problems for me. It all shifted to the left and but it left my background alone.

After this all my writing went into a 3cm space on the left hand of my screen. This made it have two or three words on a line.

After this it went back to normal which made me happy but I still have no container background.
