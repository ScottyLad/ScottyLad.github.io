15.1.18

We started of today's lesson by taking a buzzfeed quiz on their website. It took a test where you took questions about what you and your best mate would do together. After that it gave us two friends in cartoons(ie spongebob and patrick). After that we started talking about logic in coding. At the end of the lesson we finished by trying to make your own buzzfeed quiz. I struggled with ideas and i'm a bit confused how my maths logic is going to work.
