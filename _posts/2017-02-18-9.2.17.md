    <td>In today's lesson we carried on with our python coding. Today I found the exercises hard, this is probably because I am progressing further into the course. I was concentrating on pyglatin today. I found the concept quite confusing and didn't know why it is used. I am finding this a bit repetitive and not interesting now. </td>
