It lesson 24.11.16

In todays lesson we mainly did 2 things: raspberry pi and looked at our blogs. We started of this lesson by doing some work on raspberry pi. My partner and I did one short exercise then moved on to our blogs. I changed my background a few times and made the background fill the screen by saying, background-size; 100%, 100%. As a group we found out about why our pages were not updating properly. We found out it only updated on other people's computer. So a few of us teamed up to look at each others blog. This lesson I was having problems about what colour my text should be. I tried a few varieties of lots of different colours but none seemed to work. I ended up making mine yellow.

I found this lesson useful to me.
