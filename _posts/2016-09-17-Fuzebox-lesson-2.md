In this lesson we carried on with our fuzebox project. We had problems throughout the lesson involving setting up our fuzebox and we also had a problem when our screens colours switched and all went blurry. We tried to work through this but we found it quite hard and eventually asked for help. It was a fun but challenging lesson.
