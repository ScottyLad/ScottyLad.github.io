11.12.15    

In Ict today we were changing what our website looks like.

www: I think that i understood the instructions and successfully changed what my site looks after a while. Also i think i was good at using the colour picking website and how to use it.

EBI: I think i need to understand when to use # or $ because i was getting confused how to use them as i was accidently on the US keyboard
