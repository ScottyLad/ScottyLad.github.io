In Year 7 we learnt about coding. In this topic we learnt how to use Scratch and we programmed our own micro-bit game. I found this topic hard for as i have never really done coding before. I enjoyed planning our games and learning how to use all these apps. We also learnt about computer viruses and inputs-outputs.
