    <td>Today we had another lesson of codecademy python. I am finding this repetitive and boring because I find myself doing the same thing over and over again. To day the exercises I was working on was planning the money for a vacation. I find I am making silly mistakes that my friends point out. I found out that there was a Q&A forum which also helped me.</td>

    <td>My speed of working was slow today since I really struggled on the exercises. I was asking my friends if they could help me and they mainly could.I need to work on my concentration levels as this is making me do less.</td>

    <td>I find myself getting stuck on most of the exercises as I don't know what I have to do and what they mean. I need to look at what i'm writing to check it over before moving on. I am also getting a bit distracted. </td>
